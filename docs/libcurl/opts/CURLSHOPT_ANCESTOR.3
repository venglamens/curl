.TH CURLSHOPT_ANCESTOR 3 "13 Nov 2023" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLSHOPT_ANCESTOR \- easy handle to inherit from
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLSHcode curl_share_setopt(CURLSH *sh, CURLSHOPT_ANCESTOR, CURL *easy);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This passes in an easy handle that curl uses to copy values from when doing
DoH requests and uses when closing connections after all "ordinary" easy
handles are gone. When the connection cache is shared via the share API.

This handle will be closed by curl itself, do not call
\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP once the ownership has been passed on with the
\fIcurl_share_setopt(3)\fP call.

This operation cannot be reversed. The ancestor handle cannot be removed
again.

Set debug callbacks, verbose level, stderr redirects and more for this
ancestor handle to control what happens for DoH requests and when shutting
down "orphan" connections.

NULL
